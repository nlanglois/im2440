<!--
ng-app: is a directive that bootstraps AngularJS. It designates the caller element as the root. Itâ€™s usually placed on <html> or <body>.

ng-model: is a directive that usually binds form elements. For instance, input, select, checkboxes, textarea. They keep data (model) and visual elements (HTML) in sync.

{{ name }} {{ }} are a way of binding models to elements in HTML. In the example above, the ng-model name is bound to the placeholder {{ name }}. Play with the example below to see how the placeholder is updated real-time to whatever you type in the textbox.

<html ng-app>
<head>
    <title>Hello World in AngularJS</title>
</head>
<body>

<input ng-model="name" type="text" /> Hello {{ name }}
